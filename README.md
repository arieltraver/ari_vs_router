# Ari VS Router
## A quest to enable SSH on my TP-link AX3000, by whatever means necessary
From the TP Link website:<i>"SSH Services on the TP-Link products are only available for TP-Link apps. Other SSH clients cannot access to TP-Link products or adjust their settings with command lines. So please rest assured that the SSH will never cause any safety issues on your device."</i>
We will see about that!
